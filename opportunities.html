									<h2>Opportunities in the Corn Lab</h2>
								</header>
						
								<h3>Corn Lab</h3>
								<span><a href="#" class="image right"><img src="images/wsu_logo_wtext.png" alt="Washington State University" /></a></span>The Corn Lab is in Pullman, Washington, in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. We are part of the <a href="https://sbs.wsu.edu">School of Biological Sciences</span></a> at Washington State University (WSU). In addition to our live fishes and computational work, we are intimately tied to the interior Northwest's largest vertebrate collection, <a href="https://sbs.wsu.edu/conner-museum/">the Conner Museum of Vertebrates</span></a>, which has both a research collection and a public-facing display area.</p>
		
<p><b>Postdoctoral research:</b> I would be delighted to hear from you if you are interested in postdoctoral research in my lab! Please <a href="mailto:katherine.corn@wsu.edu">email me</span></a> with a CV and a brief description of your research interests if you are interested in the work that we are doing.</p>
							
<p><b>Graduate students:</b> I am always interested in hearing from motivated students who are looking for a Masters or PhD in macroevolution & functional morphology. If you are interested, please <a href="mailto:katherine.corn@wsu.edu">contact me</a> with your CV and a brief description of your research interests. For those considering a PhD, I highly recommend reading Sonke Johnsen's advice for prospective PhD students <a href="http://opticsoflife.org/advice.html">here</a></p> 
								
								<p>WSU's School of Biological Sciences ('SBS') begins application review for a fall semester start on Jan. 10. <a href="/images/Graduate-School-Application-Timeline.png">Here</a> is a suggested timeline for an application for fall semester; detailed instructions for applying to SBS are available <a href="https://sbs.wsu.edu/graduate-studies/apply/">on the SBS website</a>. All graduate programs in Biological Sciences are fully funded by a combination of research assistantship and teaching assistantships, which include tuition remission and a stipend: you will not need to pay to attend graduate school in SBS at WSU.</p>
								
								<p><i>International students:</i> Unfortunately, SBS cannot sponsor Teaching Assistant appointments for students who are not eligible to become residents of Washington. For this reason, I can only consider international applicants that have fellowship support. If you would like to explore this option and have a funding agency for a fellowship in mind, I would be delighted to discuss your proposal materials.</p>

<p><b>Undergraduates:</b> I am accepting undergraduate researchers in a limited capacity at this time. If you are interested in joining the Corn Lab and Conner Museum community, please <a href="mailto:katherine.corn@wsu.edu">email me</a> with a brief description of your background and your interests.</p>

								
								<h3>Pullman, Washington</h3>
								<p><span><a href="#" class="image right"><img src="images/IMG_5050.jpeg" alt="Progress Flag" /></a></span>The Corn Lab is in Pullman, Washington. Pullman is a college town in the Palouse in eastern Washington, around 4 hrs' drive from Seattle, with excellent restaurants and easy access to beautiful outdoor recreation. We are very lucky to be part of the vibrant Palouse ecology and evolution community.</p>
								<p>Washington state is an excellent place to live, with strong legal protections for women, people of color, undocumented individuals, and the LGBTQIA2S+ community.</p>

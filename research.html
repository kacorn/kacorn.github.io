								<p><b>The over-arching question of my research is: How does the evolution of form and function contribute to the accumulation and maintenance of biodiversity?</b></p>
								<p> I approach this question in a variety of ways, focusing mostly on the diversity of fish feeding mechanisms. My work includes videography of live fishes, large-scale morphological datasets of museum specimens, and development of phylogenetic comparative methods for better leveraging the data we have about organisms into the methods we use to model their evolution. To do this work, I integrate functional morphological studies of live animals in the lab and field (ask me about Belize!) with museum specimens and statistical models of evolution.
								<h2>Major research themes</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images

How do fishes modify their feeding apparatus to capture prey with diverse mechanical properties?</b> Nearly all fishes are capable of using suction feeding for prey capture. Suction is a dynamic feeding mechanism that relies on rapid expansion of the head, and the density and viscosity of water, to pull in water and a prey item. Yet there are many common prey, such as algae, corals, and sponges, that are attached to the substrate and not easily captured with suction. Many fishes have evolved a novel feeding mode, which we refer to as “biting,” to scrape, graze, or yank these prey directly form the substrate. Biting is a wholly different functional process than suction: where suction relies on expansion of the jaws, biting relies on compression and force transmission directly through the jaw apparatus. This novelty is an opportunity to ask a range of questions about the adaptive evolution of novelty, how fishes can modify an existing feeding apparatus to capture different prey, and more. </p>

How do the mechanical properties of organismal anatomy contribute to speeding or slowing the pace of morphological and kinematic evolution?</b> Everything on Earth is subject to the laws of physics. Some of these laws include fundamental tradeoffs of motion, such as the ability to move a structure a large distance or forcefully, but not both. These trade-offs are pervasive, as it is impossible to optimize every task, but it is not clear whether they promote or slow the evolution of morphology and of organismal motions ("kinematics"). Some organisms evade these constraints by evolving complex mechanisms to move more quickly or more forcefully than their structure should allow, like the spring-loaded jaws of trap-jaw ants. Other organisms choose to focus on one task and accept performing poorly at the other. I have explored this pervasive phenomenon in the feeding apparatus of fishes, where we found that the effects of the trade-off vary between kinematics and morphology: experiencing the force-motion trade-off in feeding mode may promote the evolution of morphology, but slow the evolution of feeding kinematics (left: the diversity of mobility in the feeding apparatus of reef fishes; figure from Corn et al 2021 Syst Biol). </p>

Fish drawings by Katherine Corn."/></span><b>3) How has historical contingency and biogeography affected the diversity of freshwater fishes?</b> I am interested in how clades with shared ecological and physiological characteristics can diversify into different niches and ecologies. Recent work by Sarah Friedman has shown that marine fishes have evolved body shape diversity with strong phylogenetic signal, but that freshwater fishes have convergently evolved along similar ecological gradients in different drainages. I am interested in what factors contribute to shared ecological, morphological, and kinematic diversity across replicated radiations of freshwater lineages. </p>
								<p>My current work on this topic is on the kinematic evolution of cichlids in collaboration with the <a href="https://fishmorph.com">Martinez Lab at UC Irvine</a> and the <a href="https://fishlab.ucdavis.edu">Wainwright Lab</a> at UC Davis.</p>

Image by Katherine Corn."/></span><b>4) Integrating performance landscapes into macroevolution</b> A gradient of success at a given task based on physical characteristics, or a "performance landscape," exists for every task that animals do. But how do organisms evolve across such a performance landscape? Often, the shape of the landscape outside of a few peaks is unknown. Biomechanical principles that underly organismal processes allow us to estimate the very performance landscape itself. <a href="https://uyedalab.com">Josef Uyeda</a> and I are using an existing performance landscape built from models of suction strikes. With this, and a kinematic dataset of fishes that use suction to capture different types of prey, we are building phylogenetic comparative models that capture the evolution of lineages across the performance landscape.</p>

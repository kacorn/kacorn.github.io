								<p><b>The over-arching question of my research is: How does the evolution of form and function contribute to the accumulation and maintenance of biodiversity?</b></p>
								<p> I approach this question in a variety of ways, focusing mostly on the diversity of fish feeding mechanisms. My work includes videography of live fishes, large-scale morphological datasets of museum specimens, and development of phylogenetic comparative methods for better leveraging the data we have about organisms into the methods we use to model their evolution. To do this work, I integrate functional morphological studies of live animals in the lab and field (ask me about Belize!) with museum specimens and statistical models of evolution.
								<h2>Major research themes</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images
/Fish_diversity_image.png" alt="Diversity of body shape among reef fishes that use different feeding moes; figure from Corn et al 2022 PNAS"/></span><b>1) How do functional innovations promote or slow the evolution of diversity?</b> Novelty in functional or ecological mode, such as the evolution of a novel feeding mode, can dramatically expand access to ecological resources or other new niches. On reefs, the evolution of biting (or feeding on "attached" prey such as algae, coral, or sponges; parrotfish biting pictured left) has been a major promoter of ecological and functional diversity among reef teleost fishes in the last 60 million years. In my future work, I am particularly interested in the role of innovations in the feeding apparatus of fishes on their morphological and kinematic diversity. </p>
								<p>Example paper on this topic: Corn, K.A., S.T. Friedman, E.D. Burress, C.M. Martinez, O. Larouche, S.A. Price, P.C. Wainwright. The Rise of Biting During the Cenozoic Fueled Reef Fish Body Shape Diversification. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 119 (31) e2119828119. <a href="/pdfs/Corn et al 2022 PNAS.pdf">pdf</a></p>
								
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/RFK_Figure_4.png" alt="The evolutionary history of cranial mobility among reef fishes: suction feeders, which are not subject a trade-off, evolve motion "kinesis" faster than biters; biters, which do experience the trade-off between force and motion, evolve morphology faster than suction feeders; figure from Corn et al 2021 Syst Biol"/></span><b>2) How do mechanical trade-offs affect the evolution of form and function?</b> Everything on Earth is subject to the laws of physics. Some of these laws include fundamental tradeoffs, such as the ability to move a structure a large distance or forcefully, but typically not both. These mechanical trade-offs underly the evolution of every motion that organisms do, because it is impossible to optimize every task that exists, but it is not clear whether they promote or slow the evolution of morphology and of organismal motions ("kinematics"). Some organisms evade these constraints by evolving complex mechanisms to move more quickly or more forcefully than their structure should allow, like the spring-loaded jaws of trap-jaw ants. Other organisms choose to focus on one task and accept performing poorly at the other. My work has suggested that experiencing the force-motion trade-off in feeding mode may promote the evolution of morphology, but slow the evolution of feeding kinematics (left: the diversity of mobility in the feeding apparatus of reef fishes; figure from Corn et al 2021 Syst Biol). </p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/cichlid_diversity_proj_slide.png" alt="Workflow of using geometric morphometrics to capture shape change of the skull from feeding videos, to explore variation in kinematics among feeding strikes. Fish drawings by Katherine Corn."/></span><b>3) How has historical contingency and biogeography affected the diversity of freshwater fishes?</b> I am interested in how clades with shared ecological and physiological characteristics can diversify into different niches and ecologies. Recent work by Sarah Friedman has shown that marine fishes have evolved body shape diversity with strong phylogenetic signal, but that freshwater fishes have convergently evolved along similar ecological gradients in different drainages. I am interested in what factors contribute to shared ecological, morphological, and kinematic diversity across replicated radiations of freshwater lineages. </p>
								<p>My current work on this topic is on the kinematic evolution of cichlids in collaboration with the <a href="https://fishmorph.com">Martinez Lab at UC Irvine</a> and the <a href="https://fishlab.ucdavis.edu">Wainwright Lab</a> at UC Davis.</p>

Image by Katherine Corn."/></span><b>4) Integrating performance landscapes into macroevolution</b> A gradient of success at a given task based on physical characteristics, or a "performance landscape," exists for every task that animals do. But how do organisms evolve across such a performance landscape? Often, the shape of the landscape outside of a few peaks is unknown. Biomechanical principles that underly organismal processes allow us to estimate the very performance landscape itself. <a href="https://uyedalab.com">Josef Uyeda</a> and I are using an existing performance landscape built from models of suction strikes. With this, and a kinematic dataset of fishes that use suction to capture different types of prey, we are building phylogenetic comparative models that capture the evolution of lineages across the performance landscape.</p>

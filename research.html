									<h2>Research</h2>

								<p>The over-arching question of my research is: How does the evolution of form and function contribute to the accumulation and maintenance of biodiversity?</p>
								<p> I approach this question in a variety of ways, focusing mostly on the diversity of fish feeding mechanisms. My work includes videography of live fishes, large-scale morphological datasets of museum specimens, and development of phylogenetic comparative methods for better leveraging the data we have about organisms into the methods we use to model their evolution.
								<h2>Major research themes</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/parrotfish_biting.png" alt="A striped parrotfish, Scarus iseri, scrapes algae off a block in the lab at UC Davis. Image by Katherine Corn."/></span><b>1) How do functional innovations promote or slow the evolution of diversity?</b> Novelty in functional or ecological mode, such as the evolution of a novel feeding mode, can dramatically expand access to ecological resources or other new niches. On reefs, the evolution of biting (or feeding on "attached" prey such as algae, coral, or sponges; parrotfish biting pictured left) has been a major promoter of ecological and functional diversity among reef teleost fishes in the last 60 million years.

The Rise of Biting During the Cenozoic Fueled Reef Fish Body Shape Diversification. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 119 (31) e2119828119. <a href="/pdfs/Corn et al 2022 PNAS.pdf">pdf</a></p>

Some of these laws include fundamental tradeoffs, such as the ability to move a structure a large distance or forcefully, but typically not both. These mechanical trade-offs underly the evolution of every motion that organisms do, because it is impossible to optimize every task that exists, but it is not clear whether they promote or slow the evolution of morphology and of organismal motions ("kinematics"). Some organisms evade these constraints by evolving complex mechanisms to move more quickly or more forcefully than their structure should allow, like the spring-loaded jaws of trap-jaw ants. Other organisms choose to focus on one task and accept performing poorly at the other. I am interested in how trade-offs affect the evolution of form and function; my work has suggested that experiencing the force-motion trade-off in feeding mode may promote the evolution of morphology, but slow the evolution of feeding kinematics (left: suction feeders, which are not subject a trade-off, evolve motion "kinesis" faster than biters; not pictured, biters, which do experience the trade-off between force and motion, evolve morphology faster than suction feeders; figure from Corn et al 2021 Syst Biol).
